# Peter-hack
A Minecraft hacked client for anarchy servers

#How to build:

Run "gradlew setupDecompWorkspace"
and run "gradlew build"

#Just one thing:
i didn't test it before, but I'm gonna test it. I will update the readme.md when I test the client :D
I ran it and i think it's fine, just some Ã¢s appear but idc 

#Special thanks:
Thank you all of the phobos developers and gopro336 for the clean buildable src!
