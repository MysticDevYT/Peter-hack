# Peter-hack
A Minecraft hacked client for anarchy servers

#How to build:

Run "gradlew setupDecompWorkspace"
and run "gradlew build"

#Special thanks:
Thank you all of the phobos developers for the client lol and gopro336 for the clean buildable src!

#IMPORTANT
I will stop the Peter-hack dev i think, cuz i'm gonna make peterware.cc and it's gonna be better than this skid.
